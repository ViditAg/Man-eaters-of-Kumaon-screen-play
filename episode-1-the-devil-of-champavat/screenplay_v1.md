FADE IN:

EXT. DENSE KUMAON FOREST - DAWN

[ANIMATION NOTE: Sweeping aerial view of mist-covered Himalayan foothills. Camera descends through thick sal forest canopy, golden sunlight filtering through leaves. Birds chirping peacefully.]

SUPER: "KUMAON REGION, UTTARAKHAND - 1907"

The peaceful forest sounds STOP abruptly. 

A YOUNG WOMAN (KAMLA, 16) moves cautiously through dense undergrowth, gathering firewood. Her colorful ghagra rustles against thorns. She hums a traditional Kumaoni folk tune.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Close-up on her face - innocent, unaware. Her movements are graceful, practiced.]

SUDDENLY - a low GROWL. Kamla freezes. Her bundle of sticks falls.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Extreme close-up on her widening eyes reflecting terror. Sound design: heartbeat intensifies.]

From the shadows emerges a MASSIVE TIGRESS - scarred, battle-worn, with gleaming yellow eyes that radiate malevolent intelligence.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The tigress moves with unnatural stealth for her size. Her coat shows old wounds. One canine tooth is visibly broken.]

KAMLA
(whispered prayer)
Hai Bhagwan... raksha karna...

The tigress POUNCES. Kamla's SCREAM echoes through the forest, then is cut short by a sickening CRUNCH.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Camera pulls back rapidly as her scream fades, showing the vastness of the forest that swallowed her.]

FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE SEQUENCE: "THE DEVIL OF CHAMPAWAT"

ACT I

INT. CORBETT'S STUDY, CHHOTA HALDWANI - NIGHT (1943)

[ANIMATION NOTE: Warm lamplight illuminates a wood-paneled study. Trophy heads and hunting photographs line the walls. Rain patters against windows.]

JIM CORBETT (67, weathered but dignified) sits at an ornate writing desk, his weathered hands moving a fountain pen across paper. The TIGRESS'S SKIN hangs prominently on the wall behind him - a silent witness to his greatest triumph.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Close-up on the journal page: "Man-Eaters of Kumaon - Chapter 1: The Champawat Man-Eater"]

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
(reflective, melancholic)
In 1943, whilst recovering from typhus fever, my friend Hawkins convinced me to write these stories down. Some memories, however, are too vivid to dim with time...

Camera slowly PUSHES IN on his lined face as he pauses, pen hovering over paper.

JIM CORBETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It began thirty-six years ago, with the kill that would bring me face to face with my first man-eater...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHAMPAWAT VILLAGE - DAY (1907)

[ANIMATION NOTE: A traditional Kumaoni village with stone houses and slate roofs. Prayer flags flutter. But the streets are eerily empty.]

The same forest clearing where Kamla died. Her body lies partially consumed. VILLAGE MEN approach cautiously, carrying spears and farming tools.

HEADMAN GOVIND (50s, traditional dhoti and turban) leads them, his face grave.

GOVIND
(in Hindi, subtitled)
Four hundred and thirty-six... She has taken four hundred and thirty-six of our people.

The men begin gathering the remains for cremation. One finds her colorful dupatta caught on a thorn.

VILLAGER
(voice breaking)
She was to be married next month...

[ANIMATION NOTE: The villager holds up the dupatta - bright red and gold, symbol of a young woman's dreams now destroyed.]

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
The Champawat man-eater had claimed her final victim in Nepal before crossing into our hills. But her reign of terror was far from over...

MONTAGE - THE TIGRESS'S REIGN OF TERROR:

[ANIMATION NOTE: A map showing the tigress's movement from Nepal into Kumaon, marked with skull symbols for kills.]

- Government BOUNTY POSTERS in Hindi and English: "REWARD - 1000 RUPEES"
- GURKHA SOLDIERS marching through villages, rifles ready
- VILLAGERS fleeing their homes, carrying meager possessions
- Empty markets, shuttered shops
- Children peering fearfully from windows

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
Two hundred killed in Nepal. Two hundred and thirty-four more in Kumaon. An entire region held hostage by a single tigress.

EXT. NAINI TAL - DEPUTY COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: British colonial architecture overlooking the pristine lake. Mountains reflected in still water.]

DEPUTY COMMISSIONER BERTHOUD (40s, harried British official) paces behind his desk. Jim Corbett sits opposite, calm and attentive.

BERTHOUD
(desperate)
Jim, we've tried everything. Professional shikaris, government hunters, the military... She's outsmarted them all.

JIM
What makes you think I'll fare any better?

BERTHOUD
Because you understand these hills. You speak their language... literally and figuratively.

Jim studies a detailed MAP OF KUMAON spread across the desk, marked with kill sites.

JIM
Two conditions, Berthoud. No government reward money - I won't profit from people's suffering. And withdraw all other hunters. They'll only get in the way.

BERTHOUD
(relieved)
Done. When can you leave?

JIM
Tomorrow.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Close-up on the map showing the concentration of kills around Champawat and Pali villages.]

EXT. FOREST ROAD TO PALI - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Scenic mountain path with rhododendron flowers. Jim rides a sturdy mountain pony, followed by three PORTERS carrying supplies.]

Jim's expression is alert, constantly scanning the forest. His rifle rests across his lap.

PORTER GANGA (30s, local guide)
Sahib, no one has traveled this road for weeks. Too dangerous.

JIM
That's exactly why we must.

They pass ABANDONED SETTLEMENTS - doors hanging open, personal belongings scattered, signs of hasty evacuation.

JIM (V.O.)
The fear was so complete that entire villages had emptied. Only the stubborn or the desperate remained.

EXT. PALI VILLAGE - EVENING

[ANIMATION NOTE: A larger village built on terraced hillsides. Smoke rises from only a few chimneys. Most houses are dark.]

Jim's party arrives to find DESERTED STREETS. A few CURIOUS FACES peer from windows before quickly disappearing.

HEADMAN DHAN SINGH (50s, dignified despite his fear) emerges cautiously.

DHAN SINGH
(in Hindi, subtitled)
Corbett sahib... we did not expect... it is not safe here.

JIM
(in fluent Hindi, subtitled)
That's why I've come, Dhan Singh-ji. Where is she taking them?

DHAN SINGH
Everywhere, sahib. No place is safe. Five days we have not left our homes.

Jim surveys the village - cooking fires dying, no signs of normal activity.

JIM
I'll need to see the kill sites.

DHAN SINGH
(shaking head)
Impossible. The men... they are too frightened.

JIM
Then I'll speak with the women.

INT. VILLAGE HEADMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

[ANIMATION NOTE: Simple stone house with low ceiling. Oil lamps provide flickering light. Women sit in traditional dress.]

SITA (40s, Dhan Singh's wife) and other VILLAGE WOMEN huddle together. Their faces show trauma - hollow eyes, trembling hands.

SITA
(voice barely a whisper)
We were cutting fodder in the forest, sahib. Twelve of us...

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY (ONE WEEK EARLIER)

[ANIMATION NOTE: Vibrant forest scene with women working. Bright saris contrast with green foliage.]

Twelve WOMEN AND GIRLS work with curved knives, cutting grass and leaves. They laugh and chat - a moment of normalcy.

YOUNG GIRL ASHA (14) climbs a tree to reach higher branches.

SITA (V.O.)
Asha was coming down from the oak tree when she slipped...

Asha falls, landing hard. She cries out in pain.

SITA (V.O.)
Before we could help her, before we could even move...

The tigress EXPLODES from the undergrowth with terrifying speed. She seizes Asha by the foot and drags her toward the ravine.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The attack happens in seconds - too fast for the human eye to fully process. The other women freeze in shock.]

ASHA
(screaming)
Ma! Help me! Please!

The women follow, throwing stones and sticks, shouting to scare the tiger.

SITA (V.O.)
We tried to follow, but she roared at us...

The tigress drops Asha momentarily and lets out a bone-chilling ROAR that echoes through the hills. The women flee in terror.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The roar is animated as visible sound waves, showing its power.]

END FLASHBACK

INT. VILLAGE HEADMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Sita wipes tears from her eyes. The other women nod, reliving the trauma.

SITA
Two men went back with guns. They fired in the air, hoping to scare her away.

WOMAN #2
She roared back at them, sahib. Like she was laughing.

JIM
(gently)
Where did this happen?

SITA
The ravine behind the village. But no one goes there now. Even the crows won't fly over it.

Jim accepts a simple meal of rice and dal. The women watch him eat, finding some comfort in his presence.

JIM
I'll sleep outside tonight.

DHAN SINGH
(alarmed)
Sahib, that is madness!

JIM
If I'm to hunt her, I need to understand how she thinks. Fear will cloud my judgment.

EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

[ANIMATION NOTE: Moonlit scene with long shadows. Jim sits with his back against a large deodar tree, rifle across his knees.]

The night is alive with sounds - owls hooting, insects chirping, bamboo creaking in the wind. Every sound makes Jim alert but not afraid.

JIM (V.O.)
I had spent countless nights in these forests, but never hunting a man-eater. This tiger had developed a taste for human flesh - and with it, a cunning that bordered on supernatural.

A TWIG SNAPS nearby. Jim freezes, finger on trigger. A BARKING DEER steps into a moonbeam, sees him, and bounds away.

Hours pass. Jim fights sleep, his eyes constantly scanning the darkness.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Time-lapse showing the moon's movement across the sky, shadows shifting.]

DAWN breaks with bird songs. Villagers emerge to find Jim sitting calmly, unharmed. They stare in amazement.

DHAN SINGH
(awed)
The sahib has slept in the open and lived...

JIM
(standing, stretching)
Now, will you show me where she hunts?

ACT II

EXT. FOREST RAVINE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Dense forest with steep rocky ravines. Ancient trees form a canopy that blocks most sunlight.]

Jim, accompanied by reluctant villagers, examines the kill site. He moves like a detective, reading signs invisible to others.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Jim's perspective: pug marks in soft earth, disturbed vegetation, claw marks on tree bark.]

JIM
She's a large female, past her prime. See here - she favors her right front paw.

He points to subtle details in the pug marks.

JIM (CONT'D)
And here - dried blood on this thorn. But not from her victim.

VILLAGER
(confused)
What does it mean, sahib?

JIM
She's injured. That's what made her a man-eater.

Jim carefully collects scattered bones and fragments of clothing.

JIM (CONT'D)
We'll need these for the cremation. In Hindu tradition, proper rites must be performed.

The villagers are moved by his understanding of their customs.

GANGA
(touched)
Sahib knows our ways.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Central courtyard with villagers gradually emerging from their homes as confidence builds.]

Jim's presence has a calming effect. WOMEN venture out to fetch water. CHILDREN peer curiously from doorways.

Jim sits with village ELDERS, sharing information.

ELDER HARISH
She has a pattern, sahib. Always attacks in daylight. Never at night.

JIM
That's unusual. Most tigers prefer dawn or dusk.

ELDER HARISH
This one is different. Evil, some say.

JIM
Not evil. Desperate. Show me how she moves.

EXT. TERRACED FIELDS - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Beautiful stepped agricultural terraces carved into hillsides. Golden wheat ready for harvest.]

Jim stands guard while villagers cautiously begin harvesting. His rifle is ready, eyes constantly moving.

For the first time in weeks, normal life begins to return. People work, talk, even laugh occasionally.

JIM (V.O.)
My presence gave them courage, but I knew the tigress was watching too. Waiting for the right moment.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Rocky outcrops with sparse vegetation. Natural amphitheater formation.]

Jim decides to demonstrate his hunting skills to build trust. He spots a GHOORAL (mountain goat) on a distant ridge.

The villagers watch as Jim takes careful aim. The shot ECHOES through the hills.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Slow-motion sequence of the bullet's path, hitting its target cleanly.]

The ghooral falls. Villagers cheer - their first celebration in months.

VILLAGER
(excited)
Sahib's aim is true! The tiger will fall the same way!

That evening, the village FEASTS on the ghooral. Trust is building.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Jim alone, tracking. He moves with fluid grace, reading the jungle like a book.]

Jim finds more pug marks, fresher this time. He follows the trail to a WATERING HOLE.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Crystal clear pool reflecting sky. Disturbed mud around the edges.]

JIM
(to himself)
She drinks here regularly. Always approaches from the east.

He notices something else - HUMAN HAIR caught on a low branch.

JIM (CONT'D)
Recent kill. Very recent.

EXT. SMALL HUT - EVENING

[ANIMATION NOTE: Humble dwelling with a woman sitting motionless outside, washing clothes in a metal basin.]

Jim approaches a small hut where SUNITA (30s), the MUTE WOMAN mentioned in the notes, sits washing clothes. She looks up, recognizes him, and bows respectfully.

She points to her throat, shaking her head sadly. Then points toward the forest.

JIM
(gently)
You saw her, didn't you?

Sunita nods vigorously, tears in her eyes. She makes gestures - a large shape, pawing movements, terrible fear.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Her expressions and gestures vividly convey terror and trauma.]

JIM (CONT'D)
She took someone from your family?

Sunita holds up a small PHOTOGRAPH - her young daughter.

Jim bows his head respectfully. He places a gentle hand on her shoulder.

JIM (CONT'D)
I will find her. I promise.

JIM (V.O.)
The tiger had stolen more than lives. She had taken voices, hope, the very essence of normal existence.

MONTAGE - BUILDING THE LEGEND:

[ANIMATION NOTE: Series of quick scenes showing Jim's growing reputation and the tiger's continued elusiveness.]

- Jim tracking through various terrains
- Villagers whispering about his skill
- False rumors spreading (that he dresses as a woman to hunt)
- More kills discovered, always one step behind

JIM (V.O.)
Days turned to weeks. The tigress seemed to sense my presence and changed her patterns. She was learning, adapting - hallmarks of a truly dangerous adversary.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Winding path through dramatic mountain scenery. Jim's party has grown to include volunteers from various villages.]

Jim's party now includes FIFTEEN MEN from different villages. They travel with purpose but also fear.

VILLAGER MOHAN
(pointing ahead)
Champawat village, sahib. The tiger's main territory.

The group crests a ridge and sees CHAMPAWAT spread below - a larger settlement built on multiple terraces.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Sweeping view of the village with Himalayan peaks in the background.]

A RUNNER approaches from the village below, waving frantically.

RUNNER
(breathless, in Hindi)
Sahib! Come quickly! She has killed again!

The group's mood instantly darkens.

EXT. CHAMPAWAT VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Scene of recent violence. Disturbed earth, scattered belongings.]

Jim finds the body of a YOUNG WOMAN, killed in broad daylight while collecting water. The brass water pot lies dented nearby.

VILLAGER RAJA
(voice shaking)
I saw it happen, sahib. She came from nowhere, in full sunlight. Bold as daylight herself.

JIM
How long ago?

RAJA
One hour, maybe less.

Jim examines the scene carefully. The trail is fresh.

JIM
She's close. Very close.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Jim's heightened awareness - every shadow, every sound scrutinized.]

JIM (V.O.)
This was her four hundred and thirty-sixth human kill. Each one had made her bolder, more confident in her dominion over these hills.

INT. CORBETT'S STUDY, CHHOTA HALDWANI - NIGHT (1943)

[ANIMATION NOTE: Return to framing device. Jim pauses in his writing, lost in memory.]

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
But it was the next kill that would seal her fate. A kill so brutal, so audacious, that it would unite the entire region in a demand for justice.

He dips his pen again, continues writing.

JIM CORBETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And it was this kill that would teach me something profound about living under the shadow of a man-eater...

EXT. DAK BUNGALOW - NIGHT

[ANIMATION NOTE: Colonial-era rest house with wide verandas. Lantern light spills from windows.]

Jim meets with TAHSILDAR KRISHNA SINGH (40s, local government official), a man of intelligence and determination.

TAHSILDAR
Corbett sahib, we must discuss strategy. The panic is spreading to other districts.

JIM
What do you propose?

TAHSILDAR
There's a bungalow closer to her hunting grounds. We could base operations there.

JIM
Dangerous. We'd be in her territory.

TAHSILDAR
(grimly)
Everywhere is her territory now.

INT. DAK BUNGALOW - NIGHT

[ANIMATION NOTE: Simple furnishings, maps spread on a table, oil lamps providing light.]

Jim and the Tahsildar study detailed maps and reports.

TAHSILDAR
Three kills this week alone. Always during the day, always when people are working.

JIM
She's not just hunting for food anymore. She's established dominance through terror.

TAHSILDAR
The people speak of her as if she were a demon. Some believe she cannot be killed by ordinary means.

JIM
(firmly)
She's flesh and blood. But she's also the most dangerous animal I've ever tracked.

A sound outside - FOOTSTEPS running. A young BOY bursts in, tears streaming down his face.

BOY
(gasping, in Hindi)
Sahib! Come quickly! The shaitan has taken another!

ACT III

EXT. OAK GROVE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Ancient oak trees with gnarled branches. Dappled sunlight creates an almost mystical atmosphere.]

Jim follows a clear trail of horror - a BROKEN NECKLACE, torn fabric, STRANDS OF HAIR caught on thorns.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Each clue tells part of the story. Camera follows Jim's detective work.]

TAHSILDAR
(following behind)
The girl was only sixteen, sahib. About to be married.

Jim stops at a WATERCOURSE where the trail ends.

JIM
She brought her here to feed.

Suddenly, EARTH tumbles from above. Both men freeze.

JIM (CONT'D)
(whispered)
She's here.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Extreme tension. Every muscle in Jim's body coiled for action.]

Jim slowly raises his rifle, scanning the rocks above. The Tahsildar holds his breath.

A shadow moves among the boulders. Then... nothing.

JIM (CONT'D)
(after a long moment)
Gone. But she was watching us.

TAHSILDAR
(shaken)
How do you know?

JIM
I could feel her eyes.

EXT. HILLSIDE ABOVE VILLAGE - EVENING

[ANIMATION NOTE: Panoramic view of the valley. Villages scattered like jewels among green terraces.]

Jim and the Tahsildar plan their strategy.

JIM
We'll organize a beat. Drive her toward the gorge where she can't escape.

TAHSILDAR
How many men?

JIM
Every able-bodied man in the district. This ends tomorrow.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The two men silhouetted against the sunset, preparing for the final confrontation.]

JIM (V.O.)
I had never attempted anything on this scale. Nearly three hundred men, all their lives dependent on the accuracy of my rifle.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

[ANIMATION NOTE: Torchlit gathering. Faces in firelight - some hopeful, others terrified.]

The Tahsildar addresses the assembled villagers.

TAHSILDAR
(in Hindi, subtitled)
Tomorrow we end this terror! Corbett sahib will position himself at the gorge. We will drive the shaitan to him.

ELDER JAGAT
And if she breaks through our line?

JIM
(standing)
She won't. But if any man feels he cannot do this, leave now with honor. No shame in admitting fear.

No one moves.

VILLAGER BHAIRAV
(passionate)
She took my wife, sahib. My daughter. I will be there.

Murmurs of agreement ripple through the crowd.

JIM
Then we begin at dawn.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

[ANIMATION NOTE: Misty morning light. The scale of the operation becomes clear - men positioned across miles of mountainside.]

Nearly 300 men take positions across the hillside. They carry drums, pots, horns - anything to make noise.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Aerial view showing the human chain stretching across the landscape.]

Jim positions himself near a narrow GORGE - the only escape route for a driven animal.

JIM (V.O.)
I had three cartridges. Against a tiger that had killed over four hundred people, three chances seemed pitifully few.

The signal is given. The beat begins.

MONTAGE - THE GREAT BEAT:

[ANIMATION NOTE: Orchestrated chaos. The sound builds from multiple sources into a wall of noise.]

- Drums THUNDERING across the hills
- Men shouting in unison
- Pots and pans CLANGING
- Horns BLOWING
- Birds exploding from trees in panic

EXT. GORGE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Jim crouched behind rocks, rifle ready. Sweat beads on his forehead despite the cool air.]

Jim waits, every sense alert. The noise of the beat grows closer.

Then - SILENCE.

The beaters have stopped. In the sudden quiet, Jim hears his own heartbeat.

A RUSTLE in the bushes ahead.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Extreme close-up on Jim's eyes, pupils dilated with concentration.]

The tigress emerges - magnificent, terrifying, scarred by years of battle. Her yellow eyes fix on Jim with intelligence and rage.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The tigress in all her deadly beauty. Battle-scarred but still powerful.]

Jim aims carefully, fires. The bullet strikes her shoulder. She staggers but doesn't fall.

WOUNDED, she turns toward the rocks to escape.

JIM
(calling out)
Tahsildar! Your rifle!

The Tahsildar's rifle is passed down. Jim checks it quickly - the sight is bent.

JIM (CONT'D)
(muttering)
Damn.

EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: The wounded tigress has climbed onto a projecting rock over a stream. She's cornered but still dangerous.]

The tigress, bleeding but defiant, crouches on the rocky outcrop. Her eyes burn with fury and pain.

Jim aims the faulty rifle, knowing he has only one chance.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Slow-motion sequence. The shot, the bullet's path, the tigress falling.]

The bullet strikes. The great tigress collapses and falls into the stream below.

For a moment, complete silence. Then...

VILLAGERS
(distant shouts)
She's down! The shaitan is dead!

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: The beaters surge forward, initially with weapons raised for vengeance.]

The beaters rush down the hill, some carrying axes and swords. Their faces show years of accumulated rage.

RING-LEADER BHAIRAV
(shouting)
Pull her down! Let us hack her to pieces!

Jim raises his hand for calm as the crowd reaches the stream.

JIM
(firmly)
Wait.

He approaches the tigress carefully, rifle ready. She's dead, but he checks thoroughly.

JIM (CONT'D)
She's gone. The terror is over.

Bhairav, sword raised, stops mid-swing as reason returns.

BHAIRAV
(voice breaking)
This shaitan killed my wife... my two sons...

His rage crumbles into grief. The sword falls from his hands.

BHAIRAV (CONT'D)
We were mad, sahib. The madness has passed. Forgive us.

Jim examines the tigress's mouth, making a crucial discovery.

JIM
Look here.

He points to the tigress's broken canine teeth.

JIM (CONT'D)
A gunshot wound, probably from a hunter in Nepal. With damaged teeth, she couldn't hunt her natural prey. So she turned to easier targets.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Close-up on the broken teeth, explaining the tragedy's origin.]

TAHSILDAR
(awed)
All this suffering... from one bullet wound.

JIM
She wasn't evil. She was desperate.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: A human chain forms to carry the tigress up the steep hill. Despite their exhaustion, the men sing traditional songs of victory.]

The villagers lash the tigress to saplings and form a human chain. As they carry her up the mountain, they begin to SING - victory songs that echo across the valleys.

[ANIMATION NOTE: The procession winding up the mountainside, voices harmonizing with the landscape.]

EXT. CHAMPAWAT VILLAGE - EVENING

[ANIMATION NOTE: Torchlit celebration. The entire village has gathered. Children who haven't been seen in months emerge from hiding.]

The tigress is laid out in the village square. Villagers touch her fur, convincing themselves she's truly dead.

Jim begins skinning the animal as curious crowds gather.

TAHSILDAR
The whole district will want to see her, sahib.

JIM
Then they shall. Every village she terrorized should know she's gone.

[ANIMATION NOTE: Faces in the crowd - relief, wonder, joy gradually replacing years of fear.]

EXT. VILLAGE ROAD - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: A triumphal procession. The tigress is carried from village to village on a makeshift bier.]

MONTAGE - THE VICTORY TOUR:

- The tigress displayed in market squares
- Villagers coming from miles around to see
- Pieces of her hide distributed as protective charms
- Children laughing and playing freely for the first time in years
- Markets reopening, normal life resuming

JIM (V.O.)
For months, she had been larger than life in their imaginations. Seeing her dead body, magnificent but mortal, broke the spell of terror she had cast over the hills.

EXT. SUNITA'S HUT - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: The same humble dwelling where we met the mute woman earlier.]

Jim stops at Sunita's hut. She emerges, sees the tigress skin draped over his horse.

Her eyes widen in shock and recognition.

SUNITA
(first words in years, whispered)
Mar gaya... she is dead?

[ANIMATION NOTE: Extreme close-up on her face as speech returns - wonder and disbelief.]

JIM
(gently)
Yes. She will never hurt anyone again.

SUNITA
(voice growing stronger)
My voice... it has returned!

She calls out to the village in excitement. Children come running, amazed to hear her speak.

CHILD
(in Hindi, subtitled)
Sunita auntie can talk! The sahib brought back her voice!

Jim watches this small miracle with deep satisfaction.

JIM (V.O.)
I don't understand the medical science of shock and recovery. I only know that with the tiger's death, she found her voice again.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Jim's journey home. The same paths that were empty with fear now bustle with normal life.]

Jim travels the long road back to Naini Tal. Everywhere he passes, people wave and call out gratitude.

MONTAGE - LIFE RETURNS:

- Children playing in fields
- Women gathering water without fear  
- Markets full of goods and laughter
- Pilgrims traveling mountain paths
- Shepherds grazing flocks in high meadows

JIM (V.O.)
The hills of Kumaon were alive again. Fear had lifted like morning mist, revealing a landscape of hope.

EXT. NAINI TAL - GOVERNMENT HOUSE - DAY

[ANIMATION NOTE: Formal ceremony with British officials and local dignitaries. The lake sparkles in the background.]

SIR JOHN HEWETT, the Lieutenant-Governor, presents ceremonial gifts to the Tahsildar and Jim's companions.

SIR JOHN
For exceptional bravery in service to the people of Kumaon.

He hands the Tahsildar an engraved rifle, and other companions receive hunting knives and medals.

Jim stands quietly to one side, refusing any reward for himself.

BERTHOUD
(privately to Jim)
You won't accept any recognition?

JIM
The people's safety is recognition enough.

INT. CORBETT'S STUDY, CHHOTA HALDWANI - NIGHT (1943)

[ANIMATION NOTE: Return to the framing device. Jim finishes writing, sets down his pen.]

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
The Champawat man-eater was dead, but her legacy lived on in the stories told around fires throughout Kumaon. Stories of terror, courage, and ultimately, hope.

Jim looks up at the tigress skin on his wall - faded now but still impressive.

JIM CORBETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She had been a magnificent animal, driven to desperation by human action. In killing her, I had learned something profound about the delicate balance between man and nature in these ancient hills.

He closes the journal and extinguishes the lamp.

JIM CORBETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But she would not be my last man-eater. The forests of Kumaon held many more stories, each one a reminder that in the wild, the line between predator and prey is thinner than we care to believe.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. KUMAON HILLS - DAWN

[ANIMATION NOTE: Sweeping final shot of the Himalayan foothills at sunrise. Villages nestled in valleys, prayer flags fluttering, life proceeding in natural rhythm.]

The camera pulls back to reveal the vast Himalayan landscape - beautiful, dangerous, eternal.

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
The Devil of Champawat was gone. But the hills remembered everything - every footstep, every hunt, every life. And in remembering, they kept the balance between civilization and the wild.

FADE OUT.

END OF EPISODE

[ANIMATION NOTES FOR OVERALL PRODUCTION:
- Character design should reflect period accuracy while remaining appealing to modern audiences
- Environmental design must capture the beauty and danger of early 20th century Kumaon
- The tigress should be portrayed as magnificent but not demonized
- Sound design crucial for jungle atmosphere and building tension
- Color palette should shift from muted/dark during terror scenes to vibrant during resolution
- Traditional Kumaoni music and clothing should be researched and represented accurately]
