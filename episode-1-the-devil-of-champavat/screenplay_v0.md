TITLE: THE DEVIL OF CHAMPAWAT – SCREENPLAY ADAPTATION

FADE IN:

EXT. MALANI FOREST – DAY

JIM CORBETT (V.O.)
(reflective)
It was while shooting with Eddie Knowles in Malani that I first heard of the tiger that would become the Champawat man-eater.

Eddie, a robust Englishman, cleans his rifle, surrounded by tales and laughter. Jim listens, half-amused, half-intrigued.

EDDIE
My brother-in-law’s been sent by the government to deal with the beast. Best shikari in the world, they say.

Jim smiles, but his eyes are drawn to the distant hills.

JIM (V.O.)
But the tiger did not die. The toll of human victims only grew.

MONTAGE:
-- Government notices posted. Rewards offered. Gurkhas marching out. Villagers whispering in fear.
-- A map: NEPAL to KUMAON. Numbers: 200 dead in Nepal, 234 more in Kumaon.

EXT. NAINI TAL – DAY

Jim meets BERTHOUD, the Deputy Commissioner. Berthoud is earnest, worried.

BERTHOUD
Jim, the people are desperate. Will you help?

JIM
On two conditions: no government rewards, and all other hunters withdrawn.

Berthoud nods, grateful.

EXT. PALI VILLAGE – EVENING

Jim and his porters arrive. The village is silent, doors barred. Smoke rises from a single fire.

JIM (V.O.)
For five days, no one had left their homes. Food was running short. Terror hung in the air.

Villagers slowly emerge, eyes wide with fear. The HEADMAN greets Jim, offering a cramped room. Jim chooses to sleep outside, rifle in hand.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE PALI – NIGHT

Jim sits with his back to a tree, moonlight casting long shadows. Every rustle makes him tense. He fights sleep and fear.

JIM (V.O.)
I had spent many nights in the jungle, but never before hunting a man-eater.

Dawn breaks. Jim is found asleep, unharmed.

EXT. PALI VILLAGE – DAY

Jim tries to rally the men to show him the kill sites. They refuse. The WOMEN and GIRLS, still shaken, recount the attack.

WOMAN #1
We were cutting leaves. She was climbing down when the tiger caught her by the foot...

FLASHBACK: The TIGRESS leaps, drags the woman into the ravine. Screams. The party flees.

EXT. RAVINE – DAY

The rescue party debates. A ROAR from the bushes. Panic. They flee again. Later, a gun is fired in the air. The tiger roars back.

JIM (V.O.)
No one dared approach. The fear was too great.

EXT. VILLAGE COURTYARD – DAY

Jim stands guard as villagers harvest wheat. Slowly, life returns. Jim’s presence gives hope.

EXT. HILLSIDE – DAY

Jim, with villagers, hunts ghooral. He shoots, impressing the men. The village feasts, trust grows.

EXT. SITE OF LAST KILL – DAY

Jim examines the ground, reads the signs. He finds pug marks: a tigress, past her prime. He collects remains for cremation.

EXT. SMALL HOLDING – EVENING

Jim visits a hut. The DUMB WOMAN, traumatized, washes clothes. She bows to Jim, who is humbled.

JIM (V.O.)
I had come to shoot the man-eater, but the odds were slim. Still, something had to be done.

MONTAGE:
-- Jim wanders the jungle, searching for the tigress.
-- Villagers whisper rumors of Jim dressing as a woman to lure the tiger (he shrugs these off).

EXT. CHAMPAWAT ROAD – DAY

Jim’s party grows as men join for safety. A villager recounts seeing the tiger carry off a woman in broad daylight. The group finds her body, untouched but for the blood.

JIM (V.O.)
To live under the shadow of a man-eater is to live in terror.

EXT. DAK BUNGALOW – NIGHT

Jim meets the TAHSILDAR. They plan to move to a bungalow near recent kills.

EXT. VILLAGE – DAY

News arrives: a girl has been killed. Jim grabs his rifle, rushes with the Tahsildar.

EXT. OAK GROVE – DAY

Jim finds blood, a broken necklace. He follows the trail: sari, skirt, strands of hair on thorns. A villager joins, reluctantly.

EXT. WATERCOURSE – DAY

Jim finds the remains. The tigress is near. Earth tumbles from above. Jim readies his rifle, senses danger. The tigress slips away.

JIM (V.O.)
This was her four hundred and thirty-sixth human kill. She was clever, and she was angry.

EXT. HILLSIDE – EVENING

Jim plans a beat. The Tahsildar gathers nearly 300 men. Jim instructs them, then takes position near the gorge.

EXT. HILLSIDE – DAY

The beat begins. Drums, gunfire, shouting. The tigress appears, is wounded by Jim’s shot, but does not charge. She escapes up the rocks.

JIM (V.O.)
Three cartridges. One left. I called for the Tahsildar’s gun...

FADE OUT.

EXT. STREAM AND ROCK LEDGE – DAY

Jim approaches the stream. The wounded tigress emerges onto a projecting rock. Jim, desperate, takes the Tahsildar’s faulty gun and fires. The shot misses the mouth, hits the paw. The tigress collapses, dead at last.

UP THE HILL – CONTINUOUS

Shouts from the beaters echo: “There it is on the rock! Pull it down and let us hack it to bits!”
Jim, wary, checks the tigress, then signals for calm as the crowd surges forward, weapons raised. The ring-leader, wild with grief, brandishes a sword.

RING-LEADER
(shouting)
This is the shaitan that killed my wife and my two sons!

The crowd’s rage subsides. The ring-leader is the first to lay down his weapon.

RING-LEADER (CONT’D)
We were mad, sahib. The madness has passed. Forgive us.

Jim nods. The men gently lower the tigress and carry her to an open spot. Jim examines her mouth, discovering broken canines.

JIM (V.O.)
A gunshot wound had broken her teeth. Unable to hunt her natural prey, she turned to man.

EXT. HILLSIDE – DAY

The villagers lash the tigress to saplings. A human chain forms. They carry her up the steep hill, singing in triumph. The Tahsildar is carried as well.

EXT. RIDGE – EVENING

Jim and the Tahsildar watch the villagers disappear east, still singing. Smoke rises from the gorge below, where the last victim’s rites are performed.

EXT. TAHSIL COURTYARD – NIGHT

A torchlit procession arrives. The tigress is laid at Jim’s feet. The villagers crowd around as Jim skins the animal, cutting the job short. A police guard is posted.

EXT. CHAMPAWAT – DAY

The next day, the countryside gathers. The tigress’s remains are distributed for lockets and charms. The Tahsildar gives Jim the girl’s fingers, which he later buries at Naini Tal lake.

MONTAGE:
-- The Tahsildar and elders plan a great feast and dance. Jim, exhausted, prepares to leave.
-- Roads and paths, once deserted, fill with villagers celebrating freedom.

EXT. PALI VILLAGE – DAY

Jim, on horseback, stops at the hut of the dumb woman. He displays the tigress’s skin. The woman, shocked, regains her speech and calls out to the village. The children stare in wonder.

JIM (V.O.)
I do not know about shock or counter-shock. All I know is, her voice returned.

Jim shares tea with the villagers, recounts the hunt, and rides on, hearing their shouts of goodwill.

EXT. DABIDHURA & NAINI TAL – DAY

Jim and his pony travel the long road home. A brief encounter with a leopard delays them, but they reach Naini Tal by evening.

EXT. NAINI TAL – DURBAR – DAY

Sir John Hewett, the Lieutenant-Governor, presents the Tahsildar with a gun and Jim’s companion with a hunting knife, both engraved.

JIM (V.O.)
The story of the Champawat man-eater ended, but her shadow would linger in Kumaon for years to come.

FADE OUT.
