Open with the kill that brought Corbett to his first man-eater. Go upto when Corbett asks why didn’t you shoot.

Then go to monologue in his chhota haldwani home where he is writing his journal reminiscing the past. Basically he talks about how the villagers were scared and how he heard about the tiger first.

Then we show how he travelled, glimpses of days in village, sleeping outside scared.

We show him hunting ghoorals to show his prowess. When the villagers were no longer scared shitless, Corbett starts tracking the tiger. Finds a few bones and takes about Hindu culture and why getting few bones even was so important to the villagers.

Then he meets the mute woman. Short story of her interaction with tiger as well.

Journey to Champawat, many people in Corbett’s party. The brutal kill of naked girl that they saved. Cut to mono-logue saying that many stories like this make you wonder how it is to love under fear of man-eater.

The bunglow horror story in monologue.

Then the whole scene when the guy comes to Corbett that a girl is killed. Whole scene where the guy runs up the hill to when Corbett chases the tiger, then finally returns with a severed leg for cremation.

Planning the hunt. This is our final scene. Corbett gets the villagers ready, hunts the tiger “with a thriller kind of feel”

Corbett notices that the Tigeress was injured thus not able to hunt and turned man-eater.

Villagers wanted to hack it to pieces, but Corbett brought them to senses. They parade the tiger in all villages to show that the beast is dead.

Back to Chhota Haldwani, Corbett’s mono-logue about the final things. Show the skin of his first man-eater in background. He talks about meeting the mute woman who started speaking again. Back in office his superior awards the people who helped him. And finally life returned to villages of Kumaon.

We need visualizations for geography at coarse level (Himalayas, show Corbett’s travel, Tigers travel, she moved from Nepal to Kumaon). At fine level, when Corbet show’s the lay of the land. Jungle signs!!

In 1943, whilst Corbett was recovering from typhus fever, his close friend and manager of India's branch of Oxford Press, R.E. Hawkins, convinced him to write a book for publishing.
Using the 1935 Jungle Stories as a basis, Corbett wrote Man-Eaters of Kumaon (10 stories) which was first published by Oxford University Press in 1944.
